So for Unstructured data, there are alternative platforms for storing and managing, it is increasingly prevalent in IT systems and is used by organizations in a variety of business intelligence and analytics applications. Example: Word, PDF, Text, Media logs.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "``1.`` Functional Dependencies are fundamental to the process of Normalization Functional Dependency describes the relationship between attributes(columns) in a table.For example, if A and B are attributes of a table, B is functionally dependent on A, if each value of A is associated with exactly one value of B (so, you can say, 'A functionally determines B')\n",
    "\n",
    "``2.`` Redundancy means having multiple copies of same data in the database. An update anomaly is a data inconsistency that results from data redundancy and a partial update\n",
    "\n",
    "``3.`` Decomposition is the process of breaking down in parts or elements.It replaces a relation with a collection of smaller relations. It breaks the table into multiple tables in a database. It should always be lossless, because it confirms that the information in the original relation can be accurately reconstructed based on the decomposed relations. If there is no proper decomposition of the relation, then it may lead to problems like loss of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "``4.`` Boyce–Codd normal form (or BCNF or 3.5NF) is a normal form used in database normalization. It is a slightly stronger version of the third normal form (3NF). BCNF was developed in 1974 by Raymond F. Boyce and Edgar F. Codd to address certain types of anomalies not dealt with by 3NF as originally defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "``5.`` First normal form (1NF) is a property of a relation in a relational database. A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic (indivisible) values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain. \n",
    "Atomic domain: values in the domains on which each relation is defined are required to be atomic with respect to the DBMS.Atomic value cannot be decomposed into smaller pieces by the DBMS (excluding certain special functions). It means a column should not be divided into parts with more than one kind of data in it such that what one part means to the DBMS depends on another part of the same column.\n"

As additional requests arrive, requests are serviced only in the current direction of arm movement until the arm reaches the edge of the disk. When this happens, the direction of the arm reverses, and the requests that were remaining in the opposite direction are serviced, and so on.\n",

When a page fault occurs and no empty frames exist, then the R (referenced) bit is inspected at the hand's location. If R is 0, the new page is put in place of the page the \"hand\" points to, and the hand is advanced one position.

    " - B+Tree allows you to use comparisons in expressions such as the '=', '>', '<', '>=', '<='. The Hash can used only for equality comparisons.\n",
    " - B+ Tree finds specific item quickly which is O(log N). The Hash is faster which is O(1).\n",
    " - B+ Tree can handle order by, junctions, logic operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "``2.`` A covering index is a non-clustered index which includes all columns referenced in the query and therefore, the optimizer does not have to perform an additional lookup to the table in order to retrieve the data requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "``3.``  (1) If the table is updated, both of the index and the data file need to be updated (2) As the tree grows, it needs to constantly split and rebalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "``4.`` The log-structured merge-tree (or LSM tree) is a data structure with performance characteristics that make it attractive for providing indexed access to files with high insert volume, such as transactional log data. LSM trees maintain data in two or more separate structures, each of which is optimized for its respective underlying storage medium; data is synchronized between the two structures efficiently, in batches. One simple version of the LSM tree is a two-level LSM tree.\n",

    "**How does it works:** It compresses the data by splitting the index key into two parts; the leading group of columns, called the prefix entry (which are potentially shared across multiple key values), and the suffix columns (which is unique to every index key). As the prefixes are potentially shared across multiple keys in a block, these can be stored more optimally (that is, only once) and shared across multiple suffix entries, resulting in the index data being compressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**benefits:** It has the potential to substantially reduce the overall size of indexes. It helps both multi-column unique indexes and non-unique indexes alike and is also one of the most critical index optimization options available.\n",

    "After a transaction successfully completes, changes to data persist and are not undone, even in the event of a system failure.\n",
